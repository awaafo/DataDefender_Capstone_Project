Project Overview:





**Securing Sensitive Data in a Financial Application with AWS KMS and Cloud HSM**

Project Objective: Design and implement a secure data encryption strategy utilizing AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and AWS Cloud HSM to safeguard sensitive data at rest and in transit within the AWS cloud environment. The project emphasizes ongoing security hygiene, key management practices, and provides a roadmap for future enhancements to ensure the long-term effectiveness of data protection in the cloud. 




Project Goals:
Develop a comprehensive and secure data encryption strategy within the AWS cloud environment to significantly reduce the risk of data breaches.
Enhance the overall data security posture by centralizing key management for the encryption and decryption of sensitive data.
Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements that mandate strong encryption controls, thereby meeting industry standards for data protection.



Target Audience:
Cloud Security Architects
Security Engineers
Data Security Specialists
